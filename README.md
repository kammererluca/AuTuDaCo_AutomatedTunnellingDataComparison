# AuTuDaCo_AutomatedTunnellingDataComparison
This code is dealing with data coming from Tunnelling projects.
The main goal is to make the comparison of two data sets autamated.
One data set has data provided from exploratory works in the early stage of a tunnelling project.
The second data set containes data coming from sensors and measurement instruments installed during the excavation works.
Possible deviations between this two data sets should be detected
and clear representations of the results should help to realize fast adaptations of the tunnel design concept.
